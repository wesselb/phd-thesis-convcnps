    Let $\Y \sub \R$ be compact.
    Suppose that $[\D'] \sub [\D] $ is
    closed, is closed under translations, has multiplicity $K$, and has maximum data set size $N < \infty$.
    Let $k \colon \X \times \X \to \R$ be a continuous strictly-positive-definite function such that
    (1) $k(\vnull) = \sigma^2 > 0$,
    (2) $k \ge 0$, and
    (3) $k(\vtau) \to 0$ as $\norm{\vtau}_2 \to \infty$.
    Denote the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated to $k$ by $\Hb$.
    Let $Z$ be a topological $(\X\times\X)$-translation space.
    Let $C$ be another topological $(\X \times \X)$-translation space, let $c \in C$ be diagonally translation invariant and anti-diagonal discriminating, and denote $C' = \set{\T_\vtau c : \vtau \in \X \times \X}$.
    Then a function $\pi \colon [\D'] \to Z$ is continuous and diagonally translation equivariant in the sense of%
    \begin{equation} \ifdef{\insiderestatement}{}{\label{eq:conv_deep_set_dte_equivariance}}
        \pi \comp \T_{\tau} = \T_{(\tau, \tau)} \comp \pi
        \quad
        \text{for all $\tau \in \X$}
    \end{equation}
    if and only if it is of the form
    \begin{equation}
        \pi = \dec \comp \enc
        \quad\text{where}\quad
        \enc(D) =
            \begin{bmatrix}
               \sum_{(x, y) \in C} \phi(y) k(\vardot - (x, x)) \\
               c
           \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    with $\enc \colon [\D'] \to \Hb' \times C'$ continuous and translation equivariant,
    $\dec\colon \Hb^{K + 1} \to Z$ continuous and translation equivariant,
    and $\phi(y) = (0, y^1, \ldots, y^{K})$.
    Here $\Hb' = \enc([\D'])$ is a subspace of $\Hb^{K+1}$ which is closed and closed under translations.
