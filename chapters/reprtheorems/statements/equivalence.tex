    Suppose that $f \colon \D \to Z$ is continuous and permutation invariant.
    Then $[f] \colon [\D] \to Z$ defined by $[f]([D]) = f(D')$ for any $D'$ such that $D' = [D]$ is well defined and continuous.
    Conversely, suppose that $[f] \colon [\D] \to Z$ is continuous.
    Then $f\colon \D \to Z$ defined by $f(D) = [f]([D])$ is continuous and permutation invariant.
