# Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes

This is the LaTeX source for my PhD thesis _Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes_.

Notable features are that all chapter are individually compilable with fully working cross-references,
and that mathematical statements are restatable with a simple custom solution. 

Please cite the thesis as follows:
